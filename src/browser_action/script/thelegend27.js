thelegend27 = `What are you guys playing?
I'm supposed to be playing game of war but this one player keeps kicking my ass.
Is it TheLegend27?
Yeah, TheLegend27.
Who is TheLegend27?
Some say TheLegend27 is the first Game of War player ever. Born from fire. Favored by the god of war.
I heard TheLegend27 can hurl a boulder further than a catapult.
I heard TheLegend27 once defeated an entire army with a single blow.
I heard TheLegend27 once challenged the sun to a staring contest and that's why we now have night.
Well, what can be done to stop TheLegend27?
Stop TheLegend27? Ah, many have attempted, but you can't stop a waterfall with a teacup.
Unless you're TheLegend27.
Oh, that's right.
But the worst part is, just when you think you're safe, just when you think you might escape, TheLegend27 finds you. And you never even see it coming.
WHAM! Just like that.
What? No. No. No. No.
That-that's impossible.
TheLegend27 has captured my hero.
Mine too. And I had a Peace Shield up.
TheLegend27 is coming for me next I can feel it.
Aw, you guys, I'm sure it's not that bad.
You have no idea what just happened.
I might have some idea.`;
